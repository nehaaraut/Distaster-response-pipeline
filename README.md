## Introduction
In this project, the task is to analyze disaster data from a set of messages to build a model for an API that classifies disaster messages. The data set contains real messages that were sent during disaster events provided by Figure Eight. A machine learning pipeline is created to categorize these events so that one can send the messages to an appropriate disaster relief agency.

## Objectives
The Project is divided in the following Sections:

1. ETL Pipeline to extract data from source, clean data and save them in a proper databse structure
2. Machine Learning Pipeline to train a model able to classify text messages in categories
3. Web App to show model results in real time.
